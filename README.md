# Company Research
To start off this, I first created the tables for each file with appropriate data types and names to work cleanly. Afterward, I imported all the csv files to each table that I had created. Then I made queries to examine the data that was provided. I looked at the salaries of every employee in the first query. In the second I checked the employees that were fired in 1986 which was around the time of the company hiring period which was the 1980s to 1990s. Then from the department managers' file for the third, I used that to find the manager's information from the employee's file by only joining the matching ids. For the fourth query, I used the department employees file to connect all the employees to their departments which I used to see what departments each employee was in. Skipping the fifth query and going to the sixth, like the fourth query I joined the departments and employees by their id but only got the employees in the sales department. The seventh query is the same as the sixth but with both the sales and development departments. Then for the final query I grouped the last names of every employee and used count to see how many times that last name occurred from the employees. I also put it in descending order along with the last name to see how often each one occurred. Interestingly there is one last name called Foolsday that is the only one to be below a hundred and has a total frequency count of one.
